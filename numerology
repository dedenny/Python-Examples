###n numerology, the number 222 is linked to positive thoughts, clarity, and growth. Create a function called has_222() that checks if a given list contains three consecutive elements with a value of 2. If so, return True. Otherwise, return False.
def has_222(nums):
  # Loops over the list elements until the  
  #l ast two elements to avoid IndexError
  for i in range(len(nums)-2):
    # Check if index and consectutive elements
    # are equal to 2
    if nums[i] == 2 and nums[i+1] == 2 and nums[i+2] == 2:
      # Return if three consecutive 2s
      return True
  # Return False if there are not three consecutive 2s
  return False
