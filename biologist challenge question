 biologist discovered a new organism that doubles its population every week. This means that by starting with only 1 organism, a week later the biologist will have 2 organisms. The following week they will have produced a total of 4 organisms.

def double_population(weeks):
    if weeks == 0:
        return 1
    return double_population(weeks - 1) * 2
