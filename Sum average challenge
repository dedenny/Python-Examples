##Given a string str1, write a program to return the sum and average of the digits that appear in the string, ignoring all other characters.


##Challenge: Return length of the longest consecutive substring of numeric characters.

txt = "of123456hi"
nums = "0123456789"

count = 0
sum = 0

for char in txt:
  if char in nums:
    count += 1
    sum += int(char)

print("Sum of digits: " + str(sum))
print("Average of digits: " + str(sum/count))
