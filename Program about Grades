## We want to create a program that will ask the user what their grade is and output their associated letter grade.

grade = input("What is your numerical grade?")

#Convert the user's input from a string type to integer
grade = int(grade)

if grade > 90:
	print("A")
elif grade > 80:
  print("B")	
elif grade > 70:
	print("C")
elif grade >= 65:
	print("D")
else:
  print("F")
