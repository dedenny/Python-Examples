#DJ Program

##Create a program that manages song requests for a DJ. The program should:

##Continuously ask the user to enter a song title. Exit the program if the user enters Quit.
##If the song title was previously requested, notify the user and share the song position.
##Example: ‚ÄúThe song Hero has already been requested. It is song number 3 on the list.‚Äù
##Otherwise, add the song to the request list, notify the user and share the song position.
##Example: ‚ÄúThe song Fantasy has been added. It is song number 10 on the list.‚Äù
