Problem #1
What is the return value of the function call mystery([1,2,3,4], 10)?

def mystery(lst, i):  
  if len(lst) == 0:
    return None
  return lst[i % len(lst)]
  
  The return value of mystery([1,2,3,4], 10) is 3.
  
  Problem #2
What is the return value of the function call mystery([8,1,2,9,4,6])?

def mystery(lst):  
  for x, y in enumerate(lst):
    if x == y:
      print(x, end=" ")
      The return value of mystery([8,1,2,9,4,6]) is 1 2 4
      
      Problem #3
What is printed by executing the following code?

a = 0
b = 0
while a>=0 and b>=0:
  b +=1
print(a)
The return value of mystery([1,2,9,9,0] is [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2].

Problem #4
Write a function called print_backwards() that takes in a single parameter, lst. The function prints the given list lst in reverse order without using Pythonâ€™s built-in reverse() function.

Examples

Input: ["peach", "orange", "apple", "banana"]
Output: "banana" "apple" "orange" "peach"

Input: [1, 2, 3]
Output: 3 2 1

Input: []
Output: 

def print_backwards(lst):

  ind = -1
  while ind >= (len(lst) * -1):
    print(lst[ind])
    ind -= 1


print_backwards(["peach", "orange", "apple", "banana"])
