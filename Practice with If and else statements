# Challenge problems
## We use a series of conditional statements to check the ranges of the grade. By using elif statements in sequence, we can check the specific ranges for each grades.


## For example: If num >= 93 is False, we can then go to the next elif conditional by checking if num is > 83. When our program gets to this second conditional we know already that num cannot be >= 93 so we are checking the range between 83 < num < 93.

def calculate_grade(num):
  #check if the num is an A
  if num >= 93:
    print('A')
  # check if num is a B
  elif num > 83:
    print('B')
  # check if num is a C
  elif num > 73:
    print('C')
  #check if num is a D
  elif num >= 65:
    print('D')
  # if all other conditions are false, we know grade is a F
  else:
    print('F')
