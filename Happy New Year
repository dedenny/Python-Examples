# Write a function `happyNewYear` that takes in a single parameter, `year`. 
# If it is a new **millennium**, the function should print `“Happy New Millenium!”`. If it is a new **decade**, the function should print `“Happy New Decade!”`, otherwise it should print `“Happy New Year!”`. 

def happyNewYear(year):
  # If year is a mutliple of 1000, it's a millenium
  if year % 1000 == 0:
    print("Happy New Millenium!")
  # If year is a multiple of 10, it's a decade
  elif year % 10 == 0:
    print("Happy New Decade!")
  # Otherwise, we print Happy New Year
  else:
    print("Happy New Year!")
