##Try writing a function of your own guess_number that takes in a guess from the user and returns whether or not they are higher, lower, or on target to the secret number.

##Input: int data type that represents guess.
##Output: str data type that is either guess is higher, guess is lower, and guess is correct.

# Global Variable
secret_number = 2045

# Define the function `guess_number` here
def guess_number(guess):
  if (guess < secret_number):
    return "guess is higher"
  elif (guess > secret_number):
    return "guess is lower"
  else:
    return "guess is correct"

# Add calls to the function below
guess = input("Guess what the secret number is (int): ")
result = guess_number(int(guess))
print(result)
